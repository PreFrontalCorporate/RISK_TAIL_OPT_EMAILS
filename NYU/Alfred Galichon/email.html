    <p>Dear Professor Galichon,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be joining New York University this fall as an incoming undergraduate pursuing studies in both Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am developing a long-term theoretical research agenda titled Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), which aims to formalize how organizations—whether public, private, or supranational—can systematically allocate their resources in uncertain, interdependent environments. The foundational architecture for this project relies on optimal transport theory, convex duality, and recursive risk modeling.
    </p>

    <p>
      As part of its initial application, I am constructing a robust optimization engine with tail-risk controls, including CVaR-based logic, designed to advise central banks and public agencies on reserve buffers, risk anticipation, and allocation responses to systemic stress. The algorithm will be distributed freely to global policy institutions including the World Bank and United Nations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your groundbreaking work in matching theory, optimal transport, and quantitative economics has shaped many of the formal directions I am pursuing. I would be sincerely grateful for any thoughts you may have on the modeling or economic framing, or for references you believe would help strengthen this early-stage research.
    </p>

    <p>
      I can be reached at <a href="mailto:prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com">prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com</a> or by phone at (510) 298-8218. Additional background on my academic and project interests can be found at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prefrontalcorporate">@PrefrontalCorporate</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your contributions to the discipline and your inspiring leadership in the field of quantitative economics. I would be honored to begin a scholarly dialogue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respectfully,<br>
