    <p>Dear Professor Chen,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be entering New York University this fall as an incoming undergraduate student majoring in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am initiating a long-term research project titled Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), which aims to construct an integrated theoretical and computational framework for institutional resource allocation under structural and probabilistic uncertainty. The project focuses on deploying robust optimization techniques—particularly those involving Conditional Value-at-Risk—and draws upon concepts in data-driven decision-making and scenario modeling.
    </p>

    <p>
      A major goal of the initial phase is to develop an applied algorithm for capital allocation and stress-testing, aimed at use by central banks, financial regulators, and international organizations. Your pioneering work in distributionally robust optimization, decision-making under ambiguity, and algorithmic implementation has been invaluable to shaping the mathematical backbone of this initiative.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would be deeply grateful for the opportunity to engage with any recent developments or papers from your lab that you feel may be relevant to this effort. Any guidance you could offer as I work to bring this project to publication and global application would be profoundly appreciated.
    </p>

    <p>
      I can be reached at <a href="mailto:prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com">prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com</a> or by phone at (510) 298-8218. My background and current work are available via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prefrontalcorporate">@PrefrontalCorporate</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your important contributions to the field. I hope to initiate a thoughtful academic exchange with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respectfully,<br>
