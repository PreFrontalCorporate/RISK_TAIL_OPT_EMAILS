    <p>Dear Professor Ray,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be joining New York University this fall as an incoming undergraduate with a concentration in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am beginning a long-term theoretical research effort titled Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), which seeks to define a formal model of how institutions—ranging from firms to multilateral agencies—might dynamically allocate resources in a way that is robust to uncertainty, adaptable to internal structure, and optimized for collective sustainability.
    </p>

    <p>
      The framework integrates risk-aware optimization, CVaR modeling, and recursive incentive design. Its first practical application is the development of an algorithmic system for national and global risk forecasting, tailored to support the reserve planning and buffer strategies of central banks and crisis-response entities. I intend for this work to be offered openly to the World Bank, the United Nations, and similar organizations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your work in dynamic modeling and game theory—particularly on how agents make decisions under uncertainty and in evolving social systems—has deeply shaped the strategic backbone of this approach. I would be truly grateful for the opportunity to engage with your insights as I continue building the theoretical structure of EAT and preparing it for potential publication.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you believe there is any literature from your own work or your department that I should engage with at this stage, I will gladly study it in earnest. I can be reached at <a href="mailto:prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com">prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com</a> or by phone at (510) 298-8218. You may also view my academic background at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prefrontalcorporate">@PrefrontalCorporate</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your leadership in advancing economic thought. I hope this message marks the beginning of a constructive conversation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respectfully,<br>
