    <p>Dear Professor Zemel,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be enrolling at New York University this fall as an incoming undergraduate with a focus in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am developing a research framework called Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), which seeks to construct a rigorous, systems-oriented method for modeling and implementing institutional resource allocation in the face of structural uncertainty. The foundation of the model is built upon robust optimization, knapsack theory, recursive decision systems, and algorithmic resource balancing.
    </p>

    <p>
      A key ambition of the project is the creation of an adaptive allocation algorithm intended to assist institutions such as central banks, international organizations, and government task forces in evaluating systemic risk exposure and optimizing budget buffers. Your work in operations research and quantitative resource allocation has been directly influential in structuring the computational heart of this theory.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would be grateful for the opportunity to engage with any of your recent work or publications that you feel could enrich this direction. Should you have any recommendations, I will make every effort to study and incorporate them as I continue to refine the model toward publication and eventual institutional deployment.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am reachable via email at <a href="mailto:prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com">prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com</a> or by phone at (510) 298-8218. A summary of my academic background and ongoing work is available at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prefrontalcorporate">@PrefrontalCorporate</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your lasting contributions to the field of operational strategy and decision science. I look forward to the possibility of scholarly exchange.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respectfully,<br>
