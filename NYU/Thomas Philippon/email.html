    <p>Dear Professor Philippon,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be enrolling at New York University this fall as an incoming undergraduate student majoring in both Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently engaged in the early development of a long-term research initiative I refer to as Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), which is intended to provide a formal structure for how institutions—ranging from firms to national agencies—can allocate their resources dynamically and efficiently under conditions of systemic uncertainty and macroeconomic interdependence.
    </p>

    <p>
      A primary application of this project involves the creation of a risk-aware optimization engine designed to serve multilateral institutions, central banks, and financial regulators in stress-testing, liquidity management, and reserve strategy. The model draws inspiration from your work in financial stability, credit market structure, and the macroeconomic role of institutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your empirical and theoretical contributions have shaped my understanding of how firm-level and systemic dynamics converge. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to learn from any readings, preprints, or methodologies from your research group that you believe could inform or challenge my approach.
    </p>

      I can be reached at <a href="mailto:prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com">prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com</a> or by phone at (510) 298-8218. My background and ongoing work are also available via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prefrontalcorporate">@PrefrontalCorporate</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your extraordinary contributions to macroeconomic thought and financial economics. I hope to begin a thoughtful academic exchange with you as I pursue this research further.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respectfully,<br>
