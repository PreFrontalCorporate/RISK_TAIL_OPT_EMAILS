    <p>Dear Professor Bickel,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be entering New York University this fall as an incoming undergraduate majoring in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am presently developing a theoretical framework and applied research project called Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), designed to support dynamic institutional decision-making. A unique component of this work seeks to incorporate behavioral economic principles and cognitive decision frameworks into algorithmic allocation systems, particularly in the context of health, public finance, and institutional well-being.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your pioneering work in behavioral pharmacology, delay discounting, and neuroeconomic decision-making has provided me with essential direction in conceptualizing the behavioral dimension of EAT. I am especially inspired by the translational implications of your work for system-wide interventions in public health and financial vulnerability.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would be deeply grateful for the opportunity to review any resources or research from your group that may illuminate or enhance this framework. If there are emerging intersections between your work and computational policy modeling that you believe are worth investigating, I would be honored to learn more.
    </p>

    <p>
      I can be reached at <a href="mailto:prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com">prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com</a> or by phone at (510) 298-8218. My academic background and current projects are outlined at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prefrontalcorporate">@PrefrontalCorporate</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your transformative work on decision science and behavioral health. I hope this message can open a scholarly dialogue in service of shared goals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respectfully,<br>
      Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez<br>
