    <p>Dear Professor Oren,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be joining New York University this fall as an incoming undergraduate student majoring in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently developing an applied research initiative called Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), which seeks to provide an integrated algorithmic and theoretical framework for optimal resource allocation under uncertainty, especially within institutional and regulatory infrastructures. Central to this work is the modeling of systemic constraints, dynamic optimization, and market design for high-stakes operational environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your pioneering work in electricity market design, infrastructure resilience, and operations research has played an important role in shaping my conception of real-time resource reallocation systems. I am especially interested in how strategic behavior, regulatory limits, and stochastic systems intersect in your models—key principles I hope to embed in EAT’s evolving architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would be truly grateful for any guidance, key publications, or insights from your group that you believe could strengthen or direct this endeavor. Ultimately, my goal is to offer a robust public-good model for decision-making that could serve organizations such as the World Bank, IMF, and energy regulators.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your distinguished contributions to systems engineering and policy-relevant modeling. I hope to engage meaningfully with your work as I move forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respectfully,<br>
