    <p>Dear Professor Bertsimas,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be joining New York University this fall as an incoming undergraduate student majoring in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am presently developing a theoretical and computational framework entitled Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), which is designed to formalize decision-making processes around institutional resource distribution under deep uncertainty. A major focus of the project is a robust optimization engine that integrates CVaR and tail-risk control methods for use in disaster preparedness, reserve estimation, and budget policy design.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have studied your work on distributionally robust optimization, scenario generation, and prescriptive analytics with great admiration. Your approach to bridging theory with implementation has shaped the architecture of my modeling strategy. The vision for this project is to deliver a publishable, freely accessible infrastructure to global institutions such as the World Bank and United Nations.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there is any literature from your group—past or recent—that you would recommend for further guidance, I would be grateful for the opportunity to review it. Any reflections you may have on model formulation or deployment at scale would be extremely valuable as I continue this work.
    </p>

    <p>
      I can be reached at <a href="mailto:prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com">prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com</a> or by phone at (510) 298-8218. More about my background is available at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prefrontalcorporate">@PrefrontalCorporate</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your contributions to applied optimization and decision science. I would be honored to engage with your insight as this project evolves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respectfully,<br>
      Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez<br>
