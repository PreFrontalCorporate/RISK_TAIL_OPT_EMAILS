    <p>Dear Professor Natarajan,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be entering New York University this fall as an incoming undergraduate student majoring in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am developing a theoretical and algorithmic research initiative called Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), aimed at constructing a unified framework for institutional resource allocation in environments characterized by deep uncertainty. The project integrates tail-risk control, scenario-based planning, and dynamic budgeting mechanisms using robust optimization strategies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your work on distributionally robust optimization and risk-averse decision-making, particularly your formulation of tractable models under ambiguous probability structures, has been instrumental in shaping my thinking. I am currently working to adapt these tools to a broader model that can support fiscal preparedness in public and global institutions such as the World Bank and UNDP.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would be honored to study any work—past or present—from your group that you believe might intersect with or inform this direction. Any advice or perspectives you could offer on structural modeling or risk aggregation would be greatly appreciated as I aim to develop this research toward publication.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am reachable at <a href="mailto:prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com">prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com</a> or by phone at (510) 298-8218. More information about my academic background is available at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prefrontalcorporate">@PrefrontalCorporate</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your outstanding contributions to optimization theory and decision analytics. I hope to engage with your expertise as this project advances.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respectfully,<br>
      Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez<br>
