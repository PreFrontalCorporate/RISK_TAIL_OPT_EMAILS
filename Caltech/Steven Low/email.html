    <p>Dear Professor Low,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be entering New York University this fall as an undergraduate student majoring in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am in the process of developing a comprehensive theoretical and computational framework entitled Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT). This work aims to unify optimization and network control strategies to guide systemic institutional allocation decisions, particularly in real-time operational contexts under uncertainty and interdependency.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your foundational contributions to optimization theory, networked systems, and control of distributed infrastructures have deeply shaped the technical foundations of this work. I am especially inspired by your insights into network decomposition and distributed algorithm design, which I believe are essential to scaling EAT across large institutional networks.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there are any recent papers, tools, or perspectives you believe could inform or improve this work, I would be deeply grateful for the opportunity to learn from them. I hope to apply EAT in policy-critical contexts, potentially in collaboration with international development and financial risk organizations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your outstanding work in distributed systems and the mathematical modeling of infrastructure. I look forward to the possibility of future scholarly engagement.
