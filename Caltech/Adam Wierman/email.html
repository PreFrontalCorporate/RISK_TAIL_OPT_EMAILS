    <p>Dear Professor Wierman,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this note finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be entering New York University this fall as an undergraduate student majoring in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently pursuing a long-term research initiative entitled Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), which seeks to develop an integrated framework for organizational decision-making under uncertainty. The theory is designed to merge robust optimization, resource allocation, and systemic risk forecasting into a cohesive algorithmic structure capable of informing real-time enterprise planning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your work on stochastic systems, online algorithms, and optimization in computing infrastructure has significantly influenced the way I’m approaching the design of real-time adaptive algorithms in EAT. I’m particularly interested in your treatment of performance guarantees under limited information and how it might inform enterprise-scale deployments of EAT in volatile economic environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are open to sharing relevant recent work or insights that you feel could shape this initiative, I would be sincerely grateful. I hope to publish this research in service of global institutional resilience and to provide tools for forward-looking policy agencies and regulators.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your profound contributions to optimization and systems modeling. I hope to engage in scholarly conversation with you in the future.
