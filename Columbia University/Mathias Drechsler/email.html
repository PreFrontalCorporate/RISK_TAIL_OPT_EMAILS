    <p>Dear Professor Drechsler,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be enrolling at New York University this fall as an incoming undergraduate majoring in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently developing a long-term research project entitled Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), which aims to create a unified analytical and algorithmic framework for institutional financial allocation under deep uncertainty. One of the model's key objectives is to understand and regulate exposure to systemic and latent risk in the financial structure of enterprises and economies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your work on financial intermediation, systemic risk, and macroprudential regulation—particularly in the context of monetary policy and capital markets—has played an essential role in framing the financial stability layer of EAT. I aim to explore how risk premia and capital requirements may be endogenized into a real-time algorithm for organizational resilience and policy modeling.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would be grateful for any relevant working papers or publications that may inform this development. If you see conceptual or methodological overlaps that warrant attention, I would value your guidance as I work toward refining and eventually publishing the model for institutional use.
    </p>

    <p>
      I can be reached at <a href="mailto:prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com">prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com</a> or by phone at (510) 298-8218. My academic and research overview is available via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prefrontalcorporate">@PrefrontalCorporate</a>.

    <p>
      Thank you for your impactful contributions to financial economics. I hope to connect with you as this project progresses.
