    <p>Dear Professor Holik,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be beginning my undergraduate studies at New York University this fall, majoring in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently developing a research initiative titled Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), which aims to unify principles of algorithmic decision-making, dynamic uncertainty, and resource optimization into a cohesive theoretical framework for global institutional use. A central element of this project involves an exploration of uncertainty and information structures in decision systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your work on quantum structures in epistemic frameworks, contextuality, and the logical foundations of uncertainty has profoundly shaped my understanding of how uncertainty may be framed and operationalized in economic models. Your approach to generalized probabilistic theories opens fascinating prospects for refining risk-sensitive allocation systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to study any of your recent publications or related ongoing work that might inform this project. My goal is to publish the first modules of EAT in open collaboration with leading scholars in logic, systems theory, and decision analytics, ultimately contributing to institutions such as the World Bank and United Nations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your thought-provoking and foundational contributions to formal reasoning under uncertainty. I hope to correspond further and explore the connections between our ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respectfully,<br>
