    <p>Dear Professor Caramanis,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be enrolling at New York University this fall as an incoming undergraduate majoring in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently building out a research initiative titled Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), which aims to establish an algorithmic framework for dynamic institutional resource allocation under uncertainty. A major focus of the work is designing scalable, robust algorithms capable of managing high-dimensional data and decision layers in real-time, with particular emphasis on tail-risk regulation and predictive structural stability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your work on optimization, data-driven decision-making, and robust control—especially your treatment of distributional ambiguity and computational tractability—has directly influenced the technical framing of this model. I am especially inspired by your research that spans both theory and application in high-stakes regulatory and infrastructure systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you would be willing to share any of your current or past work that you feel might shape the future of EAT, I would be grateful to review and incorporate it. I hope this project can one day support implementation across institutional planning tools for organizations such as the World Bank and the IMF.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am reachable at <a href="mailto:prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com">prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com</a> or by phone at (510) 298-8218. Additional background on my academic and research interests is available via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prefrontalcorporate">@PrefrontalCorporate</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your powerful contributions to the field of robust systems design and machine-learning-informed optimization. I hope to correspond as this initiative advances.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respectfully,<br>
