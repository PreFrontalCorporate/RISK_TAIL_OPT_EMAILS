    <p>Dear Professor Rabin,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be joining New York University this fall as an incoming undergraduate concentrating in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently undertaking the development of a theoretical and applied framework I refer to as Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT). The intent of this work is to create a robust system for modeling institutional resource allocation under complex uncertainty, incorporating behavioral dimensions such as expectation distortion, informational asymmetries, and bounded rationality.
    </p>

    <p>
      A key ambition of this research is to integrate behavioral-economic insights into algorithmic capital planning tools for use by international agencies and state institutions. I aim to contribute a publishable, freely accessible system that aids in risk analysis and disaster-response budgeting across asymmetric and informationally fragmented environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your work on behavioral foundations of decision theory and the limits of rational choice has significantly shaped the conceptual lens through which I am building this theory. If there is any current or past work you feel is essential for this direction, I would be honored to study it and reflect on its implications for the architecture of EAT.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your enduring contributions to economic thought. I hope to learn from your work as I continue refining this framework and pursuing its practical application.
