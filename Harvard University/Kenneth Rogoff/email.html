    <p>Dear Professor Rogoff,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be entering New York University this fall as an incoming undergraduate majoring in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently engaged in the early stages of a theoretical and computational research project titled Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT). This work is intended to develop a structural framework for institutional resource allocationâ€”one that incorporates macroeconomic interdependence, capital market uncertainty, and tail-risk forecasting into a unified algorithmic system.
    </p>

    <p>
      A core objective of this project is the design of a robust optimization engine to assist central banks, sovereign institutions, and multilateral organizations in the modeling of systemic fragility and the strategic allocation of reserve buffers. Your work on sovereign risk, financial crises, and macroeconomic stabilization has been particularly formative in shaping my understanding of the global policy applications of this type of architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would be honored to study any relevant materials from your recent research, or to receive any insights you might offer regarding potential modeling constraints, theoretical risks, or macro-level implementation considerations. Your scholarship continues to shape my ambitions as I move toward eventual publication and global deployment of this work.
    </p>

    <p>
      I may be reached at <a href="mailto:prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com">prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com</a> or by phone at (510) 298-8218. My professional and academic interests are also outlined at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prefrontalcorporate">@PrefrontalCorporate</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your enduring contributions to international economics and financial policy. I would be grateful for the opportunity to begin a scholarly dialogue with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respectfully,<br>
