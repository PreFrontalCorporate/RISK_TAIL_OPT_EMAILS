    <p>Dear Professor Boyd,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be enrolling at New York University this fall as an incoming undergraduate majoring in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently developing a theoretical and algorithmic framework called Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), which seeks to formalize decision systems for real-time institutional resource allocation under uncertainty. A central component of this work involves the use of convex optimization to model structural constraints, minimize exposure to adverse outcomes, and align capital deployment with strategic objectives in complex environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your foundational work in convex optimization, disciplined convex programming, and algorithmic control has provided the mathematical scaffolding for much of what I am building. I aim to construct a system that can support global institutions—such as central banks and policy agencies—with dynamic capital stress-testing, tail-risk buffering, and algorithmic planning.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would be honored to engage with any relevant readings, lectures, or papers that you feel may deepen the clarity or integrity of this project. Your insights on practical algorithm design and model convexification would be invaluable as I continue developing the core structure of EAT.
    </p>

    <p>
      I can be reached at <a href="mailto:prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com">prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com</a> or by phone at (510) 298-8218. My academic background and ongoing research initiatives are available at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prefrontalcorporate">@PrefrontalCorporate</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your contributions to optimization and systems modeling. I hope to begin a thoughtful academic dialogue with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respectfully,<br>
