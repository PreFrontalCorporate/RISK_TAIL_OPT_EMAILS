    <p>Dear Professor Papadimitriou,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be enrolling at New York University this fall as an incoming undergraduate student majoring in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently developing a long-term research initiative titled Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), which seeks to construct a comprehensive theoretical and algorithmic framework for institutional decision-making and resource allocation. A central objective of the project is to understand and formalize how organizations can operate efficiently under informational constraints and strategic interdependencies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your foundational work in computational complexity and algorithmic game theory has been central to my formulation of this framework. I hope to incorporate computational models of rational behavior and market interaction into EAT's broader architecture. In particular, your insights into the complexity of equilibria and dynamics of algorithmic markets have helped me shape its decision layers.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would be honored to learn from your perspective on this evolving framework. If there are any articles, monographs, or working papers from your group that you believe may enrich or challenge the theoretical development of this work, I would be grateful to review them.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am reachable at <a href="mailto:prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com">prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com</a> or by phone at (510) 298-8218. My academic and project background is available at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prefrontalcorporate">@PrefrontalCorporate</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your lasting contributions to the theory of computation and strategic interaction. I look forward to the possibility of beginning a scholarly dialogue with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respectfully,<br>
      Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez<br>
