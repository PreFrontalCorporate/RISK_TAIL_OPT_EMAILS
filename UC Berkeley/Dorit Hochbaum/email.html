    <p>Dear Professor Hochbaum,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will begin my undergraduate studies this fall at New York University, majoring in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently developing a project titled Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), which seeks to provide a theoretical and algorithmic foundation for institutional decision-making under uncertainty. At the core of this research lies a rigorous commitment to scalable optimization techniques, especially in dynamic environments with interdependent constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your extraordinary work in approximation algorithms, combinatorial optimization, and resource allocation models has shaped my understanding of what efficient, real-world optimization can achieve at scale. I am particularly drawn to the practical orientation and structural clarity in your models, which I believe are essential for developing allocation systems applicable to institutions such as the World Bank and the UN.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would be grateful for any guidance or resources you believe could support this initiative. My objective is to publish a series of theoretical contributions that build toward a unified resource allocation architecture informed by robust and discrete optimization frameworks.
    </p>

      Thank you for your foundational contributions to the field. I look forward to the possibility of engaging further as this research matures.
