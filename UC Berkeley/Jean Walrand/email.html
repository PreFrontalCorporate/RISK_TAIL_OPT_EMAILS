    <p>Dear Professor Walrand,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be starting my undergraduate studies at New York University this fall, with a focus in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently developing an integrated research framework titled Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), which aims to unify principles of real-time decision-making, adaptive resource allocation, and stochastic systems modeling to support institutional governance and economic resilience at scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your work on queueing theory, stochastic networks, and congestion control—particularly in environments with asymmetric information and real-time constraints—has profoundly shaped the structure and priorities of this theory. I am especially inspired by your insights on decentralized control and game-theoretic resource coordination, which resonate deeply with the goals of EAT in designing dynamic organizational response mechanisms.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there are any publications or evolving research areas from your lab that you feel may guide this work, I would be most grateful to study them. I hope to publish EAT as an open platform to serve as a predictive and prescriptive resource for major institutional actors and regulatory agencies.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would be honored to stay in contact. I can be reached at <a href="mailto:prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com">prefrontalcorporate@gmail.com</a> or at (510) 298-8218. You may also view my academic background at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prefrontalcorporate">@PrefrontalCorporate</a>.

    <p>
      Thank you for your influential scholarship in network systems and decision analysis. I look forward to the possibility of academic engagement as this research progresses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Respectfully,<br>
