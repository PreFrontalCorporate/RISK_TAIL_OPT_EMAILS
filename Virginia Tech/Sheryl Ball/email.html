    <p>Dear Professor Ball,</p>

    <p>
      I hope this message finds you well. My name is Santiago de Jesus Villalobos-Gonzalez, and I will be beginning my undergraduate studies at New York University this fall, majoring in Economics and Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently undertaking a research initiative titled Enterprise Allocation Theory (EAT), which aspires to provide a structured framework for institutional resource allocation under uncertainty. A significant focus of this work lies in integrating behavioral insights and experimental design into algorithmic decision-making processes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your expertise in behavioral economics and experimental methodologies has been instrumental to how I’ve approached the early development of EAT. Your work on strategic decision-making, incentive structures, and auction design provides vital grounding for understanding institutional behavior in complex environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would be honored to learn from any current research or foundational resources you may suggest. Ultimately, I hope this project can contribute to an open system supporting global organizations such as the World Bank and IMF, with roots in rigorous behavioral modeling and empirical calibration.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your impactful contributions to behavioral economics and experimental strategy. I look forward to the possibility of engaging with your work more deeply.
